How It Works  

1. Responsive Design: Bootstrap and custom CSS were used to create a layout that works seamlessly on different screen sizes.  
2. Accessibility: Semantic tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`) improve navigation for assistive technologies and contribute to better SEO.  
3. User-Focused Design: Colors and elements were chosen for readability and simplicity to ensure a user-friendly experience.

The following documents are included in the `docs/` directory:  

1. Proposal: A detailed outline of the Green Academy project's goals, objectives, and scope.  
2. User Research: Insights gathered during the research phase to inform the design and development of the application.  

Future Improvements
